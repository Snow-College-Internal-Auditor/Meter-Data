This is a python script that calls out to an API for meter data for snow college. The script is designed to either pull set meters for a billing cycle
or to pull a variable amount of meters. Either choice is dependent on the what the user needs. 
In order to run the script you do need python installed onto your computer. Here is the link for that download, https://www.python.org/downloads/. You will want the most recent
Python verison.
